"С++ Developer Roadmap"
"About:"
"The C++ is still one of the most popular development languages. There is quite a number of people that want to start learning it and become a C++ developer. They face questions like: ""Where should I start? What and in what order should I study? What books should I read?""   We tried to answer these questions in the presented roadmap. The map focuses on general competencies and skills that could be found in most projects. It is designed to help those who are just starting their education or have little experience. You can create a more productive learning plan without being distracted by side information if you study the set of listed materials. It will help you to master C++ at the level that is used in many commercial projects.

"Feedback:"
"How to use:"
"The middle developer has the skills to create a design for new functionality as a part of a component or application, if even there're not enough requirements or lack of information."
"The juniors should be aware of middle/senior skills. It's enough to have a basic understanding of them."
"If you have any feedback or remarks don't hesitate to contact us. We really appreciate it. :)   To contact us choose one of the following Github approaches: - For any remarks related to repository content - go to Pull Requests and submit a new one - For any remarks related to the Miro roadmap - go to Issues and submit a new one (As a framework has no history tracker it was decided to limit a ""write"" access to this roadmap. All remarks will be added after its review and acceptance). ","https://github.com/salmer/CppDeveloperRoadmap/pulls, https://github.com/salmer/CppDeveloperRoadmap/issues"
"Optional"
"Senior"
"Middle"
"Junior"
"The senior developer has the skills to create a design and make decisions for a solution or component, taking into account a business area context."
"The junior should acquire the following skills as soon as possible: to write easy-readable and well-structured code."
"The ""steps"" are presented on this map. They're intended to show an easy for newbies to be able to get confident base knowledge about the language at the beginning."
"Ability to gather, analyze, evaluate information and make decisions based on it."

"Notify about mistakes in time"
"Accept criticism"
"Logical"
"Systems"
"Critical"
"Thinking"
"Take challenging tasks in order to develop your skills and competencies, even when there is not enough knowledge/experience (skills will develop much faster through such tasks). The main thing is to distinguish a really useful complex task that will help you to boost your skills from a dumb task that requires a scapegoat."
"Creative"
"Strategic"
"Discipline"
"Persistence"
"Initiative"
"Responsibility"
"You should be responsible for your professional development. Don't wait for the team lead to decide for you what to study. Do not forget that blind adherence to someone else's plan will sharpen your skills according to requirements of a particular company. It is better to discuss and build in your interests into the plan. If this is not done, there is a high risk of getting irrelevant skills, which will hit career opportunities. But don't overdo it: don't study absolutely everything or don't passively wait until a development plan will be created for you."

"Dispute resolution"
"Communication"
"If you read this it means you already understand why it is so important :)   Usually, it is required at least to read because you would need to understand technical documentation. But as you move up the career ladder, you will need to speak and write more confidently in English."
